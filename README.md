# Shawarma DB

This is, at the moment, a toy project for me to learn Rust.
I figured building a database might be one of the best exercises for learning a programming language.
It has all of the key features of interacting with a file system, creating a CLI, and even (hopefully) an HTTP webserver.
Depending on how it goes, I would also like to create a UI, either browser based or desktop, but still unsure the language.
